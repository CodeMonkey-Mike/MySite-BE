      bio: "I started off my career as a Software Engineer in the late 90's. I was one of those kids that thought it would be cool to be a programmer. After only a few years I found myself working for an Affiliate Marketing company in New York. It was then that I realized I that I also had a nack for Management and Internet Marketing in addition to creating software. I liked the idea of developing a vision and then putting in effort to make it grow. Over the years that followed I worked from the standpoint that I had a unique perspective as an Internet Marketer and Manager because I had a wide understanding of the business on multiple levels. Iâ€™ve worked on and developed from the ground up some large projects, founded a few successful Internet companies, and worked for some major brands.",
